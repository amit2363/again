    <p>This is one of my favorite soccer games in the recent past. It was an awesome game between Manchester City F.C. and my favorite Chelsea F.C. During this game, there were 8 goals scored between the 2 teams. It was back and forth the entire game, and the game resulted in a 4-4 draw at Stamford Bridge.</p>
